# Design Principles

1. Retrieval must be deterministic.
2. Retrieval must be auditable and explainable.
3. No embeddings, no vectors, no cosine similarity.
4. No graph traversal or multi-hop diffusion.
5. Scoring and tie-breaking must be stable.
6. Reasoning must be phase-structured and reproducible.
7. Controllability over perfection — no claim of zero risk.
8. Domain correctness remains with enterprise validation.
