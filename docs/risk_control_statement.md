# Responsibility & Risk Control Statement

This project enhances **controllability**, not **infallibility**.

It does NOT:
- guarantee factual correctness  
- provide domain expertise  
- eliminate all uncertainty  
- replace human validation  
- guarantee safety of business decisions  

It DOES:
- provide stable retrieval  
- provide stable reasoning  
- reduce drift  
- make paths auditable and reproducible  
- turn probabilistic behavior into controllable behavior  

Use responsibly in your enterprise context.
